# Hi, I'm Myat Min Htwe! üëã

I'm a junior web developer returning to tech after a 6-month break.Now I'm rebuilding my skills with a focused, practical roadmap:

- **HTML & CSS (with Tailwind)**
- **JavaScript** (currently focused here)
- **React** (coming soon)
- **PHP (Laravel)**
- **React Native** (future goal)
- Plus: databases, Git,Github and everything else a modern developer needs!

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

<!-- Add when get as many as -->
*Check My Repositories* [Repo](https://github.com/myatmh?tab=repositories)
  
Every step of my journey includes building and publishing projects on GitHub. So far, I've completed:

**üåéüöÄ More projects coming soon as I move into React and beyond!**

## üí° My Approach

I'm dedicated to continuous learning, hands-on coding, and sharing real-world projects. My GitHub will track my progress as I grow back into development, aiming for a junior developer role after finishing React.
