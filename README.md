# Hi, I'm Myat Min Htwe! üëã

I'm a junior web developer returning to tech after a 6-month break. I'm rebuilding my skills with a focused, practical roadmap:

- **HTML & CSS (with Tailwind)**
- **JavaScript** (currently focused here)
- **React** (coming soon)
- **Python (Django)**
- **React Native (Expo)** (future goal)
- Plus: databases, Git, and everything else a modern developer needs!

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

Every step of my journey includes building and publishing projects on GitHub. So far, I've completed:

- **Responsive HTML/CSS/JS Site** (fully responsive, deployed on Netlify)
- **Todo App** (uses LocalStorage, also deployed)

More projects coming soon as I move into React and beyond!

## üí° My Approach

I'm dedicated to continuous learning, hands-on coding, and sharing real-world projects. My GitHub will track my progress as I grow back into development, aiming for a junior developer role after finishing React.
